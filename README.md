  <h1>1Password for Open Source</h1>
  <p>1Password relies on open source software every day. It's fair to say that 1Password wouldn't exist without the open source community, so we want to give back and help teams be more productive and secure.</p>
  <p>Are you working on an open source project? Do you need a place to securely store and share your project's login credentials, API tokens, SSH keys, database information, and other secrets? Somewhere that also allows you to use them right in your development workflow? 1Password has your back: get a free Teams account on us.</p>
