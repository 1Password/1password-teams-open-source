# 1Password for Open Source Projects

We rely on open source software every day to develop 1Password. It's fair to say that 1Password wouldn't exist without the open source community, so we want to give back and help teams be more productive and secure.

Are you working on an open source project that needs a password manager? How about a secure place to keep and share secrets â€” social media logins, code signing certificates, ssh keys, etc? We've got your back: get 1Password Teams free on us.
