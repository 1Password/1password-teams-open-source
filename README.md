# 1Password for Open Source Projects

We rely on open source software every day to develop 1Password. It's fair to say that 1Password wouldn't exist without the open source community, so we want to give back and help teams be more productive and secure.

Are you working on an open source project that needs a password manager? How about a secure place to keep and share secrets — social media logins, code signing certificates, ssh keys, etc? We've got your back: get 1Password Teams free on us.

## How to apply

1. Create a team account: https://start.1password.com/signup/?t=B
2. Invite at least one other person to your team and [add them to the Owners group](https://support.1password.com/groups/#manage-group-membership).
3. Fork this repo and add an entry to the `Open source projects using 1Password Teams` section at the bottom of this page:

```markdown

## Requirements

To apply, you need to be a core contributor for an active open source project that is at least 30 days old. We’ll also accept applications from the organisers of community meetups and events, as well as some conferences.

Projects need to use a standard open source license and must be non-commercial. If your company is looking for an enterprise password manager, check out [1Password Business](https://1password.com/business/).

If you're not sure if your project meets these requirements, ask us [@1Password](https://twitter.com/1password) or opensource@1password.com.

## Membership details

- You'll receive a membership to [1Password Teams](https://1password.com/teams).
- You can invite core contributors to your team account.
- Team members can use the 1Password apps on all devices — Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome OS and web.
- Your membership does not expire. If you signed up before November 26, 2021, please contact opensource@1password.com to convert your two-year membership into one that doesn't need to be renewed.
- Memberships cannot be transferred or sold.

We'll review all requests and accept them at our discretion. If accepted, your project may be listed below. Memberships may be canceled if accounts are found to no longer meet the requirements.
